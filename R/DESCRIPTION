Description: The package provides tools for automated data curation, machine learning-based meteorology/weather normalization, and causal analysis of air quality interventions.
    Key features include:
    - Automated machine learning: Helps to select the 'best' ML model for the dataset and model training.
    - Partial dependency analysis: Identifies the drivers of changes in air pollutant concentrations and feature importance.
    - Weather normalization: Decouples emission-related air pollutant concentrations from meteorological effects.
    - Causal inference: Attributes changes in air pollutant concentrations to air quality policy interventions.
    The package is designed to facilitate rapid and automated air quality intervention studies, contributing to cross-disciplinary research in atmospheric science, public health, economics, and policy analysis.
